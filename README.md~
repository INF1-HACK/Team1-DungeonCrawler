====================

Team1-DungeonCrawler

To compile all the .java files from one folder and transfer the .class files to another you should use this general style while in terminal:

Format:

> ...: javac <name of folder with .java files>/*.java -d <target folder for .class files>/

Example:

> ...: javac src/*.java -d bin/

To run the programs directly from the Team1 folder you can use this style:

Format:

> ...: java -cp <folder with the .class files you want to access> <name of class> <optional: additional command-line arguments>

Example:

> ...: java -cp bin HelloWorld

An optional thing Daniel proposed we look over is a markdown tutorial for github (found on google). It may prove helpful in making text easier to read (though I'm not acquainted with it yet so I can't tell much about it).

Since I joined the team today I'd be grateful if someone can fill me in on the general idea you have about the game and any advice/proposals/comments you may have about anything. I am on Facebook most of the time I am on a PC so you can just chat me if there's anything.
